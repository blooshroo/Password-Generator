# Password-Generator
An application that can be used to generate a random password.

## Site Description:

This site will accept user inputs via prompt and confirm pop-ups in order to generate a random password to a user's specifications.

## What I did:

JavaScript! What a journey. Took about 8 million years. Ventured from a ridiculously long if/else statement to what you see here. Wanted to cry at times. Considered taking up drinking. Got there in the end. It's a Christmas MIRACLE!
